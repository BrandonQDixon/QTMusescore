## Purpose of the Program
This program is intended to give the user a quick and effortless way to adjust the pitches of all notes with standard quarter tone accidentals.  This plugin is created to be used with compositions that use the 24-TET tuning system (quarter tone tuning).  Therefore, there is no functionality implemented to change the number of cents each accidental will be changed by.
