## Purpose of the Program
This program is intended to give the user a quick and effortless way to adjust the pitches of all notes with standard quarter tone accidentals.  This plugin is created to be used with compositions that use the 24-TET tuning system (quarter tone tuning).  Therefore, there is no functionality implemented to change the number of cents each accidental will be changed by.

## Applying the Tuning
1. To apply tuning to a particular selection, select the area you would like to tune, and click Plugins, Quarter Tone Accidentals, Apply Tuning.
2. To apply tuning to the entire score, select the entire score, or nothing, and click Plugins, Quarter Tone Accidentals, Apply Tuning.
